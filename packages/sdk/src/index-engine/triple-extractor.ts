## Step 1: Entity Extraction

For each entity, provide:
- "name": The most complete, formal name of the entity. Always use full proper names — NOT surnames, nicknames, shortened forms, or abbreviations alone. Examples across domains:
  People: "Stephen Curry" not "Curry"; "Barack Obama" not "Obama"; "Marie Curie" not "Curie"; "Ada Lovelace" not "Lovelace"
  Organizations: "Goldman Sachs Group" not "Goldman"; "European Central Bank" not "ECB"; "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" not "MIT"; "World Health Organization" not "WHO"
  Technology: "Amazon Web Services" not "AWS"; "React Native" not "React"; "PostgreSQL" not "Postgres"; "Large Language Model" not "LLM" (when first introduced)
  Locations: "San Francisco Bay Area" not "Bay Area"; "United Kingdom" not "UK"; "Silicon Valley" not "the Valley"; "Cape Town" not "the Cape"
  Events: "2024 United States presidential election" not "the election"; "1984 Summer Olympics" not "1984 games"; "CES 2025" not "CES"; "World War II" not "the war"
  Legal/Science: "General Data Protection Regulation" not "GDPR"; "Clean Air Act of 1970" not "Clean Air Act"; "Hubble Space Telescope" not "Hubble"; "CRISPR-Cas9" not "CRISPR"
  Products: "iPhone 16 Pro Max" not "iPhone"; "Tesla Model 3" not "Model 3"; "GPT-4" not "GPT"
  Culture: "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame" not "Hall of Fame"; "Academy Award for Best Picture" not "Best Picture"; "The Great Gatsby" not "Gatsby"
- "type": One of: ${ENTITY_TYPES_LIST}
- "description": A one-sentence description of what this entity IS — its defining attributes, NOT its relationships to other entities
- "aliases": Other proper names, abbreviations, or widely-recognized nicknames for THIS SAME entity in the text (array of strings).
  Valid aliases: "NYC" for "New York City", "WHO" for "World Health Organization", "The Iron Lady" for "Margaret Thatcher", "Python" for "Python programming language"
  NEVER include as aliases:
  - Pronouns or pronoun phrases (he, she, it, they, them, we, his, her, its)
  - Generic references (the team, the roster, the company, the city, the league, the organization, the event, the protocol, the framework, the ingredient)
  - Surnames or first names alone (Curry, Obama, Kevin, Marie) — these are ambiguous, not aliases
  - Names of DIFFERENT entities — "FIBA Hall of Fame" and "Naismith Hall of Fame" are SEPARATE entities; "React" and "React Native" are SEPARATE; "Python 2" and "Python 3" are SEPARATE
  - Descriptive phrases (the American team, the defending champions, the former president, the lead researcher, the main ingredient)
  - Country/city names for their teams — "France" is NOT an alias of "France men's national basketball team"; "Brazil" is NOT an alias of "Brazil national football team"
  - Shortened generic forms — "Finals" is NOT an alias of "NBA Finals"; "MVP" is NOT an alias of any specific MVP award; "Olympics" is NOT an alias of "2024 Summer Olympics"

Entity rules:
- Extract a MAXIMUM of 12 entities. When the text contains more potential entities, prioritize:
  1. Primary subjects — entities the text is primarily ABOUT, not merely mentioned
  2. Entities with explicit relationships — entities that have stated connections to other entities in the text
  3. Specific over generic — prefer "2006 FIBA World Championship" over "basketball"
  4. Actors over settings — prefer entities that DO things over entities that are merely locations or backdrops
- Omit entities that appear only in lists, parenthetical asides, or as minor supporting context with no described relationships.
- Only extract specific named entities — NOT dates, dollar amounts, percentages, or generic descriptions
- If an entity is referred to by multiple names (e.g., "OpenAI" and "the company"), list the proper name variants as aliases — NOT the generic reference
- Include important entities even if they only appear once
- For events, awards, seasons, software versions, product generations, or any time/version-specific entities, ALWAYS include the year, version, or edition in the name. Each distinct occurrence is a SEPARATE entity — e.g., "2023 NBA Finals" and "2024 NBA Finals" are different, "Python 2" and "Python 3" are different, "iPhone 15" and "iPhone 16" are different, "HTTP/1.1" and "HTTP/2" are different, "Michelin Guide 2024" and "Michelin Guide 2025" are different.
- Different awards are ALWAYS separate entities even when they share words — "NBA Finals MVP" and "NBA MVP" are SEPARATE; "Academy Award for Best Picture" and "Academy Award for Best Director" are SEPARATE; "Nobel Peace Prize" and "Nobel Prize in Physics" are SEPARATE
- Entities with opposing directional or categorical qualifiers are ALWAYS separate — "Western Conference" and "Eastern Conference" are SEPARATE; "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" and "South Asian Association" are SEPARATE; "Upper Egypt" and "Lower Egypt" are SEPARATE

CRITICAL — Aliases vs. Relationships:
- An ALIAS is a different name for THE SAME entity (e.g., "NYC" is an alias for "New York City")
- A RELATIONSHIP connects TWO DIFFERENT entities (e.g., "NBA" and "Los Angeles Lakers" are connected by MEMBER_OF — "Lakers" is NOT an alias of "NBA")
- NEVER list a related entity as an alias. If "Kevin Durant" appears in text about "Brooklyn Nets", they are SEPARATE entities connected by a relationship
- Test: Could you replace one name with the other in any sentence and preserve meaning? If yes → alias. If no → separate entities with a relationship

## Step 2: Relationship Extraction

For each relationship between the entities you identified, provide:
- "subject": Must be one of the entity names from Step 1
- "predicate": A canonical relationship verb from the vocabulary below
- "object": Must be one of the entity names from Step 1
- "confidence": How confident you are (0.0 to 1.0)

${getPredicatesForPrompt()}

Relationship rules:
- Subject and object MUST be entities from Step 1 — do not introduce new entities
- ALWAYS prefer a predicate from the vocabulary above. Only invent a new predicate if NONE fit.
- Never create compound predicates (e.g., "MENTIONED_COOKING_IN")
- Use the most specific predicate that accurately captures the relationship
- Extract relationships that are explicitly stated or strongly implied in the text

## Example

Text: "Margaret Ashworth had lived in Oxford since her marriage to Edmund, who served as president of The Geographical Society. It was through Edmund's influence that she first traveled to Cairo, where she met the renowned cartographer Helena Voss. The two women corresponded for years, and Helena's bold methods deeply influenced Margaret's own work. Margaret eventually wrote Principles of Navigation, which many regarded as a challenge to Edmund's more traditional views on the subject. Helena, who had once taught at Oxford before the Society forced her departure, remained Margaret's closest intellectual ally."

Output:
{"entities": [
  {"name": "Margaret Ashworth", "type": "person", "description": "Author of Principles of Navigation, influenced by Helena Voss", "aliases": []},
